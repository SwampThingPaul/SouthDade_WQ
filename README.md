Major structural elements of the South Dade Conveyance System were constructed in the period between 1974 and 1979 to improve water supply capabilities to the southern portions of Dade County. Later structures, detention basins and project features were constructed as part of the [Modified Waters Delievery to Everglades National Park](https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/modwater.htm) (Mod Waters) and the [C-111](http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Environmental/Ecosystem-Restoration/C-111-South-Dade-Project/) Comprehnsive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) project.

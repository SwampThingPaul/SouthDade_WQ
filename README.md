# South Dade Conveyance System Environmental Information

Data and information presented herein is purely for information purposes and subject to change. The intent of this information is intended to provide a retrospective look at water quality (i.e. Total Phosphorus) and water quantity within the southern Dade county region which spans Everglades National Park eastern boundry. This repository includes relevant information including documents, maps, hyperlinks and any R or RMarkdown code associated with any analyses of water quality and quantity data in an effort to support project planning, ecosystem assessment, etc. 

Major structural elements of the South Dade Conveyance System were constructed in the period between 1974 and 1979 to improve water supply capabilities to the southern portions of Dade County. Later structures, detention basins and project features were constructed as part of the [Modified Waters Delievery to Everglades National Park](https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/modwater.htm) (Mod Waters) and the [C-111](http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Environmental/Ecosystem-Restoration/C-111-South-Dade-Project/) Comprehnsive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) project.
